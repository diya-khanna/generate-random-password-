# generate-random-password-
This repository contains a program that produces random passwords comprised of vowels and consonant combinations. 

The Problem: People often have trouble coming up with passwords that are random and hard to guess by others.

What the Program offers: A good random password should appear "pronounceable", that is, one could attempt to read it as if it was a real word. One way of doing so is by creating random words that do not have two vowels or two consonants in a row. The Random Password program generates a list of passwords that alternate between a vowel and a consonant, and whose lengths are between 4 and 8 characters each.
